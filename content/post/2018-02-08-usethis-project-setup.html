<p>One of the packages that was a highlight for me from rstudio::conf2018 was usethis.</p>
<p>This package forms part of the package building workflow but also general project workflows.</p>
<p>In a package development workflow some of the key functions are:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># creates a new dir and populates with a skeleton containing examples
usethis::create_package(&quot;/path/to/create/package&quot;)

# creates an R script in the R/ dir (don&#39;t need to include the .R extension)
usethis::use_r(&quot;filename&quot;)

# series of license templates such as mit, gpl3, cc0 etc
usethis::use_*_license_license(&quot;name&quot;)

# initialises a testthat dir to put tests
usethis::use_testthat()

# creates a testfile
usethis::use_test(&quot;filename&quot;)

# creates a README file for you package
usethis::use_readme_md()</code></pre>
