```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = FALSE)
```


This came up in my twitter feed from Rbloggers and looks pretty useful as a set and forget type thing.

See https://www.r-bloggers.com/speeding-up-package-installation-2/ for the actual post

Basically, install.packages() uses the environment setting for Ncpus, which by default is set to 1. 

The current setting can be found with
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# the second argument returns 1 if Ncpus is not set, instead of NULL
getOption("Ncpus", 1L)
```

Ncpus can be set with this command before running install.packages()

```{r, eval = FALSE}
options(Ncpus = 4)
```

Or you can stick it '~/.Rprofile' so that it is loaded each time you run R
